# Benchmarking approaches to access SRA FASTQ datasets

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) curated by the NCBI is a fantastic resource for finding and accessing publicly available sequence data.
I am grateful for this fantastic resource, but multiple times in the past I have run into issues knowing how best to retrieve FASTQ files.
I am creating this repository to provide periodic timings and notes for different ways of accessing FASTQs from SRA. Selected sample `SRR32596108`
to download fairly arbitrarily. This sample has 8.3M paired-end 145 bp-length reads.

The different approaches currently being used are
- [aria2c EBI](scripts/aria2c_ebi.bash) which downloads from EBI's mirror of SRA
- [prefetch, fasterq-dump](scripts/prefetch_and_fasterqdump.bash) which is SRA's recommendation
- [aws, fasterq-dump](scripts/aws_and_fasterqdump.bash) which directly downloads the .sra file from aws instead of using prefetch
- [fasterq-dump only](scripts/fasterqdump_only.bash) which is running fasterq-dump without prefetch of aws.
    - This is explicitly NOT recommened by NCBI
- [fastq-dump only](scripts/fastqdump_only.bash) which is just running fastq-dump for comparison.

## Notes
- The `aria2c EBI` approach results in gzipped versions of the fastq files
    - timing includes un-gzipping, which is arguably unfair
- The fastq files returned by `aria2c` vs. the other approaches doesn't have the same shasum
    - but it does have the same number of lines
    - There may be some differences in the files hosted by SRA and EBI, but maybe just for quality scores
- aria2c downloading from `ftp://` was ~2-3X slower than from `https://` with aria2c
    - This seems strange since the URI's for EBI are `ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq`
- The timings are measured on github actions runners, so might not be reflective of your experience

## TODOs
- Write up a discussion of learnings
